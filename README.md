# Component inspector

![Example for React](https://github.com/lahmatiy/component-inspector/raw/master/docs/img/intro.gif)

General purpose of tool is showing components boundaries and its DOM fragment with some details. It could be extended by features like [source fragment locating](#locating-components-source) and [opening file in editor](#opening-file-in-editor).

It's still a **proof of concept**. Generally it's an adoptation of [basis.js](https://github.com/basisjs/basisjs) tool for other component frameworks and libraries. Here is ready to use builds for [React](#react) and [Backbone](#backbone). But you also could [use inspector with custom API](#api-free-build) for your own component solution.

## Install

```
npm install component-inspector --save-dev
```

## Usage

There are 3 options to use Component Inspector:

- use one of ready-to-use build for certain framework or library
- use API free build and init inspector with custom API
- make you own build as ready-to-use solution (PRs are welcome)

### Ready to use builds

In case you use one of ready-to-use editions (i.e. `React` or `Backbone`) there is no any public API. Just include apropriate script and here you are.

#### React

![React example](https://github.com/lahmatiy/component-inspector/raw/master/docs/img/react.png)

You should include `component-inspector` script **before** `React` script.

```html
<script src="node_modules/component-inspector/dist/react.js"></script>
<script src="react.js"></script>
```

#### Backbone

![Backbone example](https://github.com/lahmatiy/component-inspector/raw/master/docs/img/backbone.png)

You should include `component-inspector` script right **after** `Backbone` script.

```html
<script src="backbone.js"></script>
<script src="node_modules/component-inspector/dist/backbone.js"></script>
```

### API free build

In case you want to use inspector with your own API adapter you should use `dist/base.js` script. When script included into html only one public function available â€“ `initComponentInspector(api)`. This function could be invoked just once. It takes API methods that override defaults.

```html
<script src="node_modules/component-inspector/dist/base.js"></script>
<script>
  initComponentInspector({
    isComponentRootNode: function(node){
      return Boolean(node && node.__view);
    },
    getInstanceByNode: function(node){
      if (node) {
        return node.__view;
      }
    },
    getInstanceRootNode: function(instance){
      if (instance) {
        return instance.rootNode;
      }
    }
  });
</script>
```

All methods are optional. Most important method is `isComponentRootNode` that checks DOM node is component root node. Also `getInstanceByNode` and `getInstanceRootNode` could be used to resolve DOM fragment owner (component instance) and owners root element. Other methods could provide additional information.

#### isComponentRootNode(node)

Returns `true` if DOM node is root node of some component. Uses to determine component boundaries.

#### getComponentNameByNode(node)

Returns component name if possible. This name using in component short details.

#### getInstanceByNode(node)

Function to resolve component owner by DOM node if any. Usually it's some kind of `view` instance.

#### getInstanceRootNode(instance)

Should return instance's root DOM node. It's vice versa function of `getInstanceByNode(node)`. Using on DOM mutations to determine actual DOM node to inspect, as root DOM node could be changed on component re-render.

#### getInstanceClass(instance)

Should returns reference to instance class. Returns `instance.constructor` by default.

#### getInstanceLocation(instance)

Returns instance source location if possible. Normally no need to override it, as it returns `api.getLocation(instance)` by default.

#### getInstanceRenderLocation(instance)

By default it returns source location of `instance.render` method. You can override it if needed.

#### getNodeLocation(node)

If there is source location where DOM node was created this function should returns it. Uses in DOM viewer when hover nodes.

#### getNestedComponentNameByNode(node)

Used in DOM viewer to get name for nested components. Override function if those names should be provided.

#### getNestedComponentNodeLocation(node)

Allow provide location for nested component root node. If not defined `getNodeLocation` is used.

#### domAttributeFilter(attribute)

Allow to filter output attributes in DOM viewer. For example, React adds `data-reactid` attribute to every element, but we don't want to show it. In this case, method could be:

```js
domAttributeFilter: function(attr){
  return attr.name !== 'data-reactid';
}
```

#### getAdditionalInstanceInfo(instance)

Allow provide additional info for related objects. Should provide array of objects or nothing. For example, provide instance model info:

```js
api.getAdditionalInstanceInfo = function(instance){
  if (instance && instance.model) {
    return [{
      name: 'Model',
      locations: [
        { type: 'instance', loc: this.getLocation(instance.model) },
        { type: 'class', loc: this.getLocation(instance.model.constructor) }
      ]
    }];
  }
};
```

#### getLocation(value)

Should returns source location, where value was defined. By default return `loc` value from `getDevInfo()`

#### getDevInfo(value[, property])

Function provides dev info attached to value. It should returns info as is if no `property` argument and property value otherwise.

```js
getDevInfo(value);
// { "loc": "file.js:1:2:3:4", ... }

getDevInfo(value, 'loc');
// "file.js:1:2:3:4"
```

#### isOpenFileSupported()

Returns `true` if `open file in editor` is supported. In this case click by source location links will call `openFile` method.

#### openFile(filename)

Should make some action to open specified filename in editor.

### Make your own build

You can make your own ready-to-use edition, see [React](src/react.js) or [Backbone](src/backbone.js) as examples.

#### Implementation

First of all, you should include `basis.js` core (as inspector was originaly implemented using it) in your base html file and specify path to your implementation module.

```html
<script src="node_modules/component-inspector/node_modules/basisjs/src/basis.js" basis-config="
  noConflict: true,    // prevents export names to global scope
  devpanel: false,
  modules: {
    myapi: {           // your implementation module
      autoload: true,
      filename: 'path/to/implementation.js'
    }
  }
"></script>
```

Example of `implementation.js`:

```js
var initInspector = require('./inspector/index.js');

initInspector({
  isComponentRootNode: function(node){
    // ..
  },
  getInstanceByNode: function(node){
    // ..
  },
  getInstanceRootNode: function(instance){
    // ..
  }
});
```

#### Build

Install `basisjs-tools`

```
npm install basisjs-tools --save-dev
```

Run build with `--single-file` option.

```
node node_modules/basisjs-tools/bin/basis --file path/to/myinspector.html --single-file --pack --same-filenames
```

As result you'll get single JavaScript file (`myinspector.js` in this example) that contains everything. Include this script in your application page.

## Additional features

### Locating component's source

Component inspector works as is, but shows only component bounds and its DOM fragment. More interesting things could be shown if some meta information (like source code location) is available.

You could use [babel plugin](https://github.com/restrry/babel-plugin-source-wrapper) with your building solution to instrument sources ([see documentation](https://github.com/restrry/babel-plugin-source-wrapper)). Also suitable dev-server could be used for instrumenting source code on the fly e.g. [basisjs-tools](https://github.com/basisjs/basisjs-tools-instrumenter).

Interface to get metadata about an object is called `$devinfo`. This interface should provide `get()` method, that returns metadata if available.

```js
$devinfo.get(obj);
// > { "loc": "app.js:..." }
```

### Opening file in editor

In case dev-server supports "open in external editor" feature, all location references become active links. A click on any of those opens a file in editor with cursor set at the start of the code fragment. You'll see a hint if feature is supported.

One possible way to provide this feature is some URL that does the job. This URL could be set via global variable `OPEN_FILE_URL`.

```js
window.OPEN_FILE_URL = '/open-in-editor';
```

There is an `Express` middleware [express-open-in-editor](https://github.com/lahmatiy/express-open-in-editor), which is able to provide an URL with necessary functionality.

In case you don't depend on dev-server, you could use [basisjs-tools](https://github.com/basisjs/basisjs-tools) that support that feature.

Roll your own implementation for your dev-server using [open-in-editor](https://github.com/lahmatiy/open-in-editor).
